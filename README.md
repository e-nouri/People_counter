# People Counter  
![](intro/demo.gif)

## Introduction  
This repository implements a people-counter, which counts people entering and leaving the building and thereby giving a count of the number of people inside. This is written in written in python and performs real-time.

### The algorithm  
#### Detection Phase  
The model used for detection is MobileNet SSD.  
In this phase we run the object tracker to:  
1. Detect new objects that have entered the view.  
2. Check if any of the existing objects "disappeared" durinf the tracking phase.
For each detected object we create or update an object tracker with the new bounding box coordinates. The detection phase is run only once in every N frames at it will be very expensive computationally.  

#### Tracking Phase
In this phase, we create an object tracker to track objects as they move in the frame. The tracking will continue until weâ€™ve reached the N-th frame.  
The entire process repeats again.
